# AI-Powered Mental Health Chatbot

### Project Overview:
Developing an AI-powered mental health chatbot designed to provide users with immediate emotional support, resources, and coping strategies. The chatbot will use natural language processing (NLP) to understand and respond to users' mental health concerns, offering a confidential and accessible way to manage stress, anxiety, and other mental health issues.

### Key Features:

1. **Emotion Detection:**
   - Implement sentiment analysis to detect users' emotions and moods based on their text inputs.
   - Adjust responses and recommendations based on detected emotions.

2. **Conversational Support:**
   - Provide empathetic and supportive responses to users’ messages.
   - Offer coping strategies, relaxation techniques, and positive affirmations.

3. **Resource Recommendation:**
   - Suggest relevant articles, videos, and exercises based on users' mental health concerns.
   - Provide information about mental health professionals and hotlines for further support.

4. **Daily Check-ins:**
   - Allow users to participate in daily mental health check-ins to monitor their mood and emotions over time.
   - Generate visual mood charts and summaries to help users track their mental health progress.

5. **Privacy and Confidentiality:**
   - Ensure that all interactions are confidential and data is securely stored.
   - Provide options for users to delete their data or anonymize their interactions.

### Benefits:

- **Immediate Support:** Offers instant access to mental health resources and support, reducing the barrier to seeking help.
- **Emotional Awareness:** Helps users become more aware of their emotions and mental health patterns.
- **Coping Strategies:** Provides practical advice and techniques to manage stress, anxiety, and other mental health issues.
- **Accessibility:** Makes mental health support accessible to users anytime and anywhere.

### Technical Requirements:

- **NLP and Sentiment Analysis:** Use frameworks like Google Dialogflow, IBM Watson, or spaCy for natural language understanding and sentiment analysis.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Utilize pre-trained models for emotion detection and fine-tune them based on user interactions.
- **Database Management:** Use databases like MongoDB or Firebase for secure data storage.
- **API Integration:** Integrate with mental health resource databases and content providers for resource recommendations.
